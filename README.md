# Cyclic Redundant Check Calculator

A cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is an error-detecting code commonly used in digital networks and storage devices to detect accidental changes to digital data.The following project efficiently calculates the CRC for the ploynomial and normal inputs.


## Usage
1.Storage Systems
2. File Transfer Protocols
3. Error Detection in Embedded Systems
4. Digital Signatures
5. Network Protocols and Routing
